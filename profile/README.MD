# Why
Most of the time I have thoughts. I try to solve problems nobody would try to solve, because of disinterest or inconvenience to their interests. I'd like to be honest and write everything about what I actually think about things. I first write them in Spanish and hope to be able to write them in English for greater accessibility.
My main two branch that I'm into to solve are:
* Everything that has to do with anthropomorphism and related to it, to try to define the phenomenon objectively. This branch is called *The Anthridote*
* Art as a phenomenon that needs a no absolutely relative, non-subjective, non-contradictory theorization, and even cientific to understand it better and get the most out of it for the human being in any situation and circumstance.
